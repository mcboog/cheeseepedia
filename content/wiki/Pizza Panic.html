<h2>History<h2>
<textarea>Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Panic is a fast-paced arcade game released in 2004 as part of a promotional lineup featuring the iconic Chuck E. Cheese character. Developed by The Dimension's Edge, Inc., and published by CEC Entertainment, the game challenges players to catch falling pizza slices and assemble them into complete pizzas before sending them out to customers. The goal is to achieve the highest score while managing the increasing speed of the gameplay. Originally a browser-based Flash game, it was popular among fans of the Chuck E. Cheese brand and offered a digital extension of the restaurant's fun-filled atmosphere.</textarea>
